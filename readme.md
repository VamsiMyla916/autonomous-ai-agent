# Autonomous AI Agent for Business Intelligence ü§ñ

[](https://www.python.org/)

This project is a sophisticated AI agent that functions as a junior business analyst. It can understand complex, multi-part questions asked in natural language, reason about a plan, and use a set of tools to autonomously gather information from different data sources to provide a comprehensive answer.

The agent is capable of querying both **structured data** from a SQL database (e.g., sales figures) and **unstructured data** from a document knowledge base (e.g., support tickets), making it a powerful tool for business intelligence.

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **Natural Language to SQL:** Allows non-technical users to query a sales database using plain English.
- **RAG on Documents:** Uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to find and synthesize information from a knowledge base of support tickets.
- **Autonomous Tool Selection:** The agent can intelligently decide which tool (SQL or RAG) is needed to answer a user's question, and can even use multiple tools in sequence.
- **Local LLM Powered:** Runs entirely on your local machine using **Ollama** and the **Llama 3** model, requiring no API keys or internet connection.
- **Interactive Web UI:** A clean, user-friendly chat interface built with Streamlit.

## High-Level Architecture üèóÔ∏è

The application follows a modern agentic architecture where the user interacts with an agent that orchestrates various tools.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Python:** Make sure you have Python 3.9+ installed.
2.  **Ollama:** You must have [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed and running.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Pull the Llama 3 Model:**
    Open your terminal and run the following command to download the Llama 3 model.

    ```bash
    ollama pull llama3:8b
    ```

2.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/autonomous-ai-agent.git
    cd autonomous-ai-agent
    ```

    _(Replace `YourUsername` with your actual GitHub username.)_

3.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

    ```bash
    # Create the environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the environment
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Set Up the Database:**
    Run the setup script to create the `sales_db.sqlite` database and populate it with mock data.

    ```bash
    python setup_database.py
    ```

6.  **Launch the Application:**
    You're all set\! Run the following command to start the Streamlit web server.

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    Your browser should automatically open a new tab with the application running.

## Usage Guide üìñ

Once the application is running, you can interact with the agent through the chat interface.

**Try asking some questions like:**

- What was our total revenue?
- Show me the top 3 clients by sales amount.
- What is the open support ticket for Innovate Solutions?
- Summarize the support ticket for our highest-paying client.
